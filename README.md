# Fine-tuning-FLAN-T-5-base
This project focuses on fine-tuning the `FLAN-T5` model on a custom dataset related to carbon-neutral pathways. `FLAN-T5`, developed by Google, is a versatile text-to-text transformer model capable of performing various natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, summarization, and translation. In this case, the `flan-t5-base` version is fine-tuned to generate text outputs based on specific carbon-neutral pathway inputs.

The fine-tuning process begins by loading the pre-trained `FLAN-T5` model and tokenizer from Hugging Face’s `transformers` library. The dataset used is "CarbonNeutralPathway" (`Ram20307/carbonetralpathway`), which is loaded via the `datasets` library. The dataset is split into training and evaluation subsets, with 90% of the data used for training and 10% for validation. The input and output text sequences are preprocessed through a custom function that tokenizes and truncates them to a maximum length of 512 tokens. The labels (output text) are adjusted to ignore padding tokens by assigning them a value of `-100`, ensuring they are not considered in the loss function during training.

For efficient training, a `DataCollatorForSeq2Seq` is used to handle dynamic padding and batch preparation, ensuring that input and output sequences of varying lengths are properly processed. Training arguments are defined, including a batch size of 4, a learning rate of 1e-4, and training over 3 epochs. The `Trainer` class from Hugging Face is used to manage the training loop, allowing easy configuration of training parameters such as the evaluation and checkpoint-saving strategies, which are set to run at the end of each epoch.

Once the model is fine-tuned, it can be uploaded to Hugging Face’s Model Hub using the `push_to_hub()` function. This fine-tuned model can be applied to generate text related to carbon-neutral pathways, making it a valuable tool for automating sustainability-related text generation tasks. The flexibility of this approach allows for further fine-tuning or adaptation to other domains as needed.
