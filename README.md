# Fine-tuning-FLAN-T-5-base
This project fine-tunes the `FLAN-T5` model on a custom dataset related to carbon-neutral pathways. Using Hugging Faceâ€™s `transformers` and `datasets` libraries, the model is trained to generate text outputs. After training, the model can be used for sustainability-related text generation tasks or further fine-tuning.
